def compute_competitive_equilibrium(budgets, valuations, supply):
    """
    Compute a competitive equilibrium for a Fisher market using CVXPY, without
    specifying a particular solver. CVXPY will use whichever solver is installed
    by default.
    
    Parameters:
    -----------
    budgets     : array-like, shape (n,)
        The budgets b_i for each of the n players.
    valuations  : array-like, shape (n,m)
        valuations[i,j] = (linear) value of good j to player i.
    supply      : array-like, shape (m,)
        The total supply of each of the m goods (often all 1.0).
        
    Returns:
    --------
    x_val  : ndarray, shape (n,m)
        The allocation matrix: x_val[i,j] = amount of good j allocated to player i.
    prices : ndarray, shape (m,)
        The equilibrium price of each good.
    spent  : ndarray, shape (n,)
        The actual spending of each player.
    utils  : ndarray, shape (n,)
        The utility each player obtains from her allocated bundle.

    Like 'compute_competitive_equilibrium' but handles the case
    where a player's valuations are all zero by excluding them
    from the log-sum objective and forcing their allocation to be zero.

More examples:

1) Complementary vs. Independent Valuations: Shows how the algorithm handles players with different valuation structures - one player values a specific good highly, another values multiple goods equally.

2) Extreme Value Differences: Tests how the market handles very strong preferences, where each player values one good 100x more than others.

3) Scarce Resources, Many Players: Shows competition dynamics when many players (5) compete for limited resources.

4) Different Valuation Scales: Tests whether the algorithm properly handles players who express their valuations on completely different scales (from 1-2 vs 100-200).

5) Abundant Resources: Tests the case where there's more than enough of each good for everyone - prices should be very low.

6) One Player Values Nothing: Tests an edge case where one player doesn't value any goods - the algorithm should handle this gracefully.
